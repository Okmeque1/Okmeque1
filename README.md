# Okmeque1

## Who am I?

I'm Okmeque1, a lone coder who does regular python stuff and occasionally batch. I code on my own, sometimes having help but most of the time I'm on my own on how to implement things with no errors. In my free time, I play games such as chess or Minecraft and sometimes update my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Okmeque1/Software) with some cool new stuff inside. Mostly what I code comes around my head, and I just implement it in the fastest way possible, that's why some of my programs look like jank. 


## When did I start?

I started coding in late 2021, as a start, my first programs were simple prints, "for" loops and other stuff, so nothing much, and then through these bases I eventually learned how to use external files which then spiraled in to more complicated loop formations until now, where I am standing. Sometime in 2023, I started venturing off into Batch and VBS, all basic languages that I still don't exactly understand, but that's a problem for future me to solve.

## Who do I work with?

Ok, maybe a slightly strange one considering it does not appear on most readme's but I don't only work on [my own repository](https://github.com/Okmeque1/Software), but I also contribute to my friend [@GamerSoft24](https://github.com/GamerSoft24) on his [Software repository](https://github.com/GamerSoft24/Software). It contains a variety of software, mostly software installers but some actual code does exist, and I do this as he started it. I keep my repository to pure code only.

## More information?

Yes, more information. First of all, most of the code I made was from scratch, with only some projects like [pwd-hash_edition.py](https://github.com/Okmeque1/software/blob/main/PythonSoft/Utilities/pwd-hash_edition.py) deriving from the base [pwd.py](https://github.com/Okmeque1/software/blob/main/PythonSoft/Utilities/pwd.py). 

On [PythonSoft](https://github.com/Okmeque1/Software/tree/main/PythonSoft), I want the people using it to know how it will work, so I made a [program chart](https://github.com/Okmeque1/software/blob/main/Programs.md), and for people still stuck on Windows XP using Python 3.4.4 and [Supermium](https://github.com/win32ss/supermium), I made a [compatability chart](https://github.com/Okmeque1/software/blob/main/PythonSoft/COMPTEST.md) for what programs will run on that version. Keep in mind that it ain't updated that much, gotta pull out the old Windows XP pc out of storage to test it.

Well that wraps this up. 

Careful - Someone is waiting for you.
