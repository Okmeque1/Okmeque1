### Hi there, fellow people ðŸ‘‹


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my [GitHub repo, `Okmeque1/Software`](https://github.com/Okmeque1/Software), but other things like getting a functional hard disk that wasn't from the dumpster...
- ðŸŒ± I own Okmeque1 Corporationâ„¢, that has its subsidiary, Okmeque1 Computers.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m collaborating with @GamerSoft24 on [his](https://Github.com/GamerSoft24/Software) repository, specifically on the InstallerSoft and PROGRAMS.MD file.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with PROGRAMS.MD on `GamerSoft24/Software` as I have enough of staring at black and blue, and with the broken file structures it's basically impossible
- ðŸ“« Wanna contact me? Go ahead : okmeque1@gmail.com. No spam or weird stuff tho.
- âš¡ Fun fact: Well, not so fun. I get headaches every week so if I don't respond on a Friday evening, this is why.
